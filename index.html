                        Believe it or not, you may just be healthier if you own a dog! Studies have shown that a furry companion can
                        lower blood pressure and even lower cholesterol levels. Dogs are a great way to reduce stress, and can lead to a
                        healthier lifestyle. By being a responsible pet owner, you will be taking your pet on walks or runs, which could 
                        lead to weight loss. <br>
                        <br>
                        The responsibility of owning a dog is what many people need in their lives. Whether you are lonely and looking for
                        companionship or you are just looking to shake up your life, a dog can be a great thing to have.

                        If you pick a dog that matches your lifestyle, it can be incredibly rewarding!
                        Having a dog is a perfect excuse to go outside and socialize where you wouldn't normally.
                        When I'm alone, my dog is always ready to go for a walk or a ride. Especially during
                        quarantine, he has been a lifesaver. 
                        <br><br>
                        Dogs have a way of sensing your emotions and and come to help when they believe you need it the most.
                        From my experience, dogs can certainly make your life a little bit more complicated, however,
                        I could never think of going back to a life without him!
